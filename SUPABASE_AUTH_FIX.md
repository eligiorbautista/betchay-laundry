# Supabase Authentication Fix

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing errors related to Supabase authentication where cookies were being set after the response had been generated. This is a common issue in SvelteKit applications when using Supabase with server-side rendering.

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Cannot use `cookies.set(...)` after the response has been generated
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because:
1. Supabase's `autoRefreshToken` was enabled on the server side
2. When tokens expired, Supabase automatically tried to refresh them
3. This refresh process attempted to set new cookies after the response had already been generated
4. SvelteKit prevents cookie setting after response generation for security reasons

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Disabled Auto Token Refresh on Server Side

In `src/lib/config/supabaseServer.ts`:
```typescript
auth: {
    autoRefreshToken: false, // Disable auto refresh to prevent cookie setting after response
    persistSession: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: false,
    // ... rest of config
}
```

### 2. Added Error Handling for Cookie Operations

Wrapped all cookie operations in try-catch blocks:
```typescript
setItem: (key: string, value: string) => {
    try {
        event.cookies.set(key, value, {
            // ... cookie options
        });
    } catch (error) {
        // Silently fail if response has already been generated
        console.warn('Could not set cookie, response may have been generated:', key, error);
    }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling in Layout Files

Added try-catch blocks in layout server load functions to prevent app crashes:
```typescript
export const load: LayoutServerLoad = async (event) => {
    try {
        const session = await getServerSession(event);
        return {
            user: session?.user || null,
            session: session
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error in layout server load:', error);
        return {
            user: null,
            session: null
        };
    }
};
```

### 4. Added Manual Session Refresh Function

Created a `refreshServerSession` function for cases where manual token refresh is needed:
```typescript
export async function refreshServerSession(event: RequestEvent) {
    try {
        const supabase = createSupabaseServerClient(event);
        const { data: { session }, error } = await supabase.auth.refreshSession();
        // ... handle result
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error in refreshServerSession:', error);
        return null;
    }
}
```

## Best Practices for Future Development

### 1. Server-Side Authentication
- Always disable `autoRefreshToken` on the server side
- Use try-catch blocks around cookie operations
- Handle authentication errors gracefully without crashing the app

### 2. Client-Side Authentication
- Keep `autoRefreshToken: true` on the client side
- Client-side token refresh is safe and should work normally

### 3. Error Handling
- Always wrap authentication operations in try-catch blocks
- Log errors for debugging but don't crash the application
- Provide fallback values when authentication fails

### 4. Session Management
- Use the provided `getServerSession` and `refreshServerSession` functions
- Don't create multiple Supabase clients unnecessarily
- Cache session data when appropriate

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to the orders page
3. Check the console for any authentication-related errors
4. Verify that the application loads without the cookie setting error

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages to ensure the fix is working:
- `Could not set cookie, response may have been generated:` - This is expected and safe
- `Error in getServerSession:` - This indicates other issues that need attention
