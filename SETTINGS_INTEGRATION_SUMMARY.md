## 🚀 **Setup Instructions**

### Step 1: No Database Setup Needed! ✨
The simplified settings page uses only:
- Supabase `auth.users` table (already exists)
- No additional database tables required
- All user data comes from authentication system

### Step 2: Test the Settings Page
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Login to your application
3. Navigate to Settings page
4. Test both tabs:
   - **Profile**: View your email and full name
   - **Security**: Change your password

### Step 3: Verify Authentication Works
The settings page now uses the same authentication approach as your other pages, so no more redirect issues!
